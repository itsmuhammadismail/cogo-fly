    <p>{% trans "Having had the chance to work together with FRANCK on several projects, I have had the opportunity to accompany him on several business trips; he is the kind of guy you will never forget, always willing to provide assistance to all kinds of people. I believe it is part of his genetic profile to be on Earth, help people and make them happy, in both small and great ways. I believe his site is part of this process and constitutes a real inner part of his personality; almost as if it were the logical conclusion to a personal ambition dedicated to fulfilling everybody's needs and, more precisely, passion for travelling, and the embedded necessity for everybody to interchange." %}</p>

    <h2>Michel Wauthier</h2>
    <p>{% trans "I have known Franck for quite a while now. He has a unique way of meeting people, striking up relationships, genuine and sincere ones, and is very loyal when it comes to friendship. Always on the move, dynamic, full of new ideas, with a real entrepreneurial spirit, he has shown courage and determination by putting everything he has into a project in which he wholeheartedly believes; a project with the goal of bringing people closer together, and getting them to meet up with each other. A project which, upon reflection, resembles him a great deal; and it is for this reason that it has to work. And not just for him, but for those whom it will help to \"co-go-fly\": new faces for new trips and places." %}</p>

    <h2>Benjamin Mallows</h2>
    <p>{% trans "I've known Franck for several years now and his will to succeed, drive and motivation are simply second to none. It's a real pleasure to work with people like Franck because you always have that peace of mind, safe in the knowledge that results are guaranteed. Franck is a loyal and trustworthy colleague and friend who, I have no doubt about it, has the profile and all the prerequisites to be the very best. His project is a fascinating one and I'm very much looking forward to seeing all of his hard work pay off." %}</p>

    <h2>Florent Portes</h2>
    <p>{% trans "Franck is the designer and creator of this website, he asked me to help him for the development, I was motivated by this idea to find a solution for all these people that don’t want to travel alone, indeed, times are difficult these days, for all, economic crisis, current situation, terrorism but the fact you can find hope despite all these bad things happening is first of all a noble idea and to take a stand in this world, and to see few persons motivated to develop this project, this is a really creative and innovative idea, to allow people that don’t know each other, to meet, travel and the more you get to know someone, the closer you feel to them, and these friendships will last, because love is stronger than all things, and we need to defend this love in this chaotic world today. Franck is a committed person, I have only known him for a few years but what struck me is his strength of conviction, close to stubbornness but to do good, and to seek quality, what struck me again is his motivation, he refuses to fail, I am motivated to work with him to see these qualities and concepts in him, his desire to succeed and to bring forth his vision, because it is with small and simple things that great things are achieved." %}</p>
